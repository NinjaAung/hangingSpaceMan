### Spaceman

Spaceman is a guessing wordgame. The user will guess a word if a character is correct and in the right place it will show up, each wrong answer will draw a part of a spaceman... wait this is literally illegal hangman, okay.

### Learning Outcomes
Completing this project will make me able to do
1. Build a game loop that is aware of wins and losses
2. Use control flow to decide what action your program should take based on given information
3. Use at least one of the following collection types to store data: lists, tuples, dictionary


### Whats working right now?
- [x] Starter code
- [x] Entire code runs without errors
- [ ] Words are properly generated
- [ ] Game atcually works
- [ ] Win/lose after 7 lost
- [ ] Ask to play again


### Stretch goals
- [ ] Alert the user if they guessed a letter they already guessed, dosen't count
- [ ] Actually hangman rules
- [ ] Restart Game || Player prompts new game
- [ ] Change the number of incorrect guesses allowed to match the length of the mystery word
- [ ] Show the user the mystery word when they lose
- [x] Use ASCII art to draw the spaceman
